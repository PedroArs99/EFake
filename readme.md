Efake is a Web App Technologies subject project. 
The goal is to create a platform similar to Amazon or Ebay,
 where sellers are able to upload products and users can by them, but, in this case we're not implementing the selling process. 

Please feel free to get in and have a look on  **_Efake_**.

## Technologies
Efake stores data in a MySQL Database, using Java EE Technologies on the backend,
 so alongside JSP as template render engine and Bootstrap 4 we have achieved a nice look on the frontend side.
